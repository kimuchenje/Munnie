“Hello world”

My name is Kimberley Tanatswa Muchenje. I am an international student from Harare, Zimbabwe. I am currently doing a PhD at Caltech in the department of Biology and Biological engineering. My research interests are around the fields of Genomics and Bioinformatics. I am in the process of crafting a research project that is an intersection between those two fields and this project may likely be around the regulation of gene expression, something that I have been curious about for a while now. 

Come along on my journey as I generate bioinformatic data analysis workflows, borrowing from already existing computational tools but adding my own input and knowledge about which methods are optimized for what kind of datasets.
